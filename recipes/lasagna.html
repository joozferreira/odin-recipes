        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who can say no to a magnificent lasagna?!</p>
        <p>It takes time to prepare it, but it is absolutely astonishing to eat it afterwards. Either for a family meal or just for yourself, this is a must do!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: Sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: A can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce and two cans of tomato sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: Fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Store-brought or homemade</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella and ricotta cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
